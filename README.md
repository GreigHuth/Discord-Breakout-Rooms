# Discord-Breakout-Rooms
A discord bot that organises users in a voice chat into breakout rooms, not unlike zoom or blackboard collaborate


# Usage
`/breakout <number of rooms you want>`

# Setup

The only dependency needed is discord.py which can be installed from [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).

Rename config-template.py to config.py and add the relevant information to config.py and you're good to go.
